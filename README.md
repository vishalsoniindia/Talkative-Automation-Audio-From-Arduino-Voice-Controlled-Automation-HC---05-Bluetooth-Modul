Please SUBSCRIBE To my YouTube channel for more videos........  In this video we have built a Talkative Automation..  When you will send a voice command via mobile then it will turn on home devices and send feedback in voice.  Like "TV on"  "fan on"  We have use SD card module to interface micro sd card and get audio output.  Many of People want to interface the SD card with arduino or want some audio output via arduino.  So here is easiest and cheapest way to interface SD card with arduino . you can use the audio output from arduino via a switch or sensor . you can play any type of sound ,music and recording but that audio will be in to .wav file. If it is in .mp3 or any other audio type then we will convert it into .wav file.
